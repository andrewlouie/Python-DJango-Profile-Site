  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr>
<img src="8.jpg" width="640" height="960" alt="Barb Shannon" class="aboutpic"/><p>I am a registered member of the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (OCSWSSW), member of the Ontario Association of Social Workers, and have a Master of Social Work.  I have studied issues of diversity, addictions and treatment, mental health, family therapy, individual therapy and group therapy.  I have 15 years of clinical and case management experience working with children/youth and families, as well as experience facilitating parent-teen mediation services.  
</p>
<h4>My Approach</h4>
<p>I believe it's imperative that our relationship is built on mutual trust, honesty and respect.  I strive to ensure that you feel safe and can speak freely about the thoughts and feelings you may have difficulty talking about with others.  My clients tell me that my genuineness and level of openness about my observations, interventions and advice is what they value the most in me as a Counsellor/Therapist.  
</p><p>
My approach is from a strengths-based, trauma-informed perspective and I use a variety of approaches and interventions with children, youth, adults and families which are tailored to meet individual’s specific needs and counselling goals.  Overall, my work is an integration of cognitive-behavioural therapy, solution-focused therapy and narrative therapy.  I am committed to regular and on-going training and research so I can offer the highest level of current and evidence-based therapy to individuals.
