<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<div id="accordion">
<h3>Q: How quickly can I get a dumpster rental?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Typically you will see a dumpster delivered within 1 – 2 business days… However, we understand last-minute emergencies that can only be address with an Ottawa dumpster rental. For example, a flooded basement must have its contents emptied immediately so it can be repaired asap, unforeseen renovation debris, or you sold your home and the buyer is not interested in keeping your furniture. We will always do our absolute best to accommodate your needs.</p></div>
<h3>Q: Does all my junk need to be thrown over the sides of the dumpster?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Our dumpsters have big barn doors at the rear so appliances and heavy furniture can be easily loaded into the bin.</p></div>
<h3>Q: I have a shared driveway, will the bin fit?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Our dumpster bins are designed for residential use. Our 20 yard bins will have no problem fitting into a single driveway.</p></div>
<h3>Q: I live in a condo building; can I put a bin on the street?</h3>
<div><p>
A: The City of Ottawa’s by-law permit takes at least a week to approve and costs about $350.00. Once you acquire the permit we will have no problem parking on the street. If this is not a viable option for you, certainly have our full-service junk removal team swing by to clean up same day.</p></div>
<h3>Q: My neighbour takes pride in his properties appearance, are your bins kept clean?</h3>
<div><p>
A: We promise our dumpsters won’t upset your neighbour! We keep them clean so they are not an eyesore.</p></div>
<h3>Q: Do I get a delivery time for my bin?</h3>
<div><p>
A: We can provide a time-frame but it is very difficult to give an exact estimated time of arrival due to traffic, travel and line-ups at recycling and dumping facilities. Expect a drop-off between 8:00 am – 2:00 pm. Our hassle-free service means you don’t have to be home at the time of drop-off!</p></div>
<h3>Q: Why is the weight an additional charge?</h3>
<div><p>
A: We like to keep it simple! Capital Bins wants to stand out among the crowd, so we only charge our clients for the weight that is used. Your receipt lists the weight of your items and how it was calculated. There are no additional fees or surcharges, just the flat rental rate plus disposal.</p></div>
<h3>Q: What am I not allowed to put in the bin?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Please visit bin Rental Rules for more information on what cannot be placed on the bin.</p></div>
<h3>Q: Where does my junk go?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Most of your junk is going to be recycled, re-purposed or donated. Everything else is taken to the landfill. We make every effort to sort through your materials in order to remove all the items that can be saved from the landfill.</p></div>
<h3>Q: Are your trucks licensed and properly insured? Is your staff covered under ‘Worker’s Compensation’?</h3>
<div><p>
A:  Capital Junk is fully licensed by the M.O.E (Ministry of the Environment) to legally haul Residential and Commercial waste. We are also registered with the C.V.O.R (Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration) which allows us to operate commercial trucks. We hire experienced staff members and they are fully covered under The Worker’s Compensation Act in case of accidental injury.
</p></div>
<h3>Q: Will your bin damage my driveway?</h3>
<div><p>
A: With our modern and advanced hook-lift system of delivering dumpsters, the bins are placed down very gently and will not damage your driveway or interlock. Our crews care about your property and take every precaution to make sure your driveway does not sustain any damages.</p></div>
<h3>Q: How do I know what the weight will be for the items in my bin?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Unless you know what the weight is of the items you are throwing in the bin, you won’t know what the weight is until we have picked up your dumpster and have it weight on a federally inspected scale by third party transfer station workers.</p></div>
<h3>Q: Do I need to be at the location when you drop off and pick up my bin rental?</h3>
<div><p>
A: No, you do not have to be onsite when the bin is dropped off or picked up. Every detail is arranged over the phone.</p></div>
<h3>Q: How do I pay for the rental?</h3>
<div><p>
A: We accept VISA, MasterCard and American Express. Cash, debit or money order is not an accepted method of payment.</p></div>
<h3>Q: How do I arrange a drop-off?</h3>
<div><p>
A: Simply call our office at (613) 825-0707 and speak to a friendly customer service representative or conveniently book online </p></div></div></div>

<p>We cannot accept a down payment in cash or as a debit card transaction because we will not know what your total cost is until we have weighed the truck and its dumpster at the transfer station.

<h2>Rental Rules</h2>

<p>Our bins are best used for residential waste and small construction projects. We have a weight restriction on our truck and it cannot withstand a dumpster that contains heavy and dense materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concrete, brick or stone</li>
<li>Soil, sod and other clean fill</li>
<li>Asphalt and asphalt shingles</li>
<li>Lots of paper, books, magazines</li>
<li>Lots of ceramic tile</li>
</ul>
<h4>We cannot accept any hazardous items in our bins such as:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Paint cans and other household chemicals</li>
<li>Liquids of any kind – no exceptions!</li>
<li>Bedbug contaminate</li>
<li>Asbestos</li>
<li>Extreme mold</li></ul>
<p>Everything else can be placed in your bin rental! We accept old tires, beds, furniture, appliances and other construction materials such as wood, drywall, laminate flooring and ceiling tiles.</p>

<p>We kindly ask our clients not to overfill the bin.</p>

<p>We request a favour to please place any appliances, old tires and paper at the back of the bin last. If you place these items in last, or on top of your waste, we can recycle these materials with ease. It helps us save time so we can quickly empty and clean the bin and deliver it to the next client!
